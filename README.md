Arduino sketch for the Open Grade Simulator - an open hardware and software incline simulator for indoor cycle training

Matt Ockendon

This is the controller for a 3D printed elevation or 'grade' simulator to use with an indoor trainer
The project in inspired by the Wahoo Kickr Climb but shares none of its underpinnings.

Elevation is simulated on an indoor trainer by increasing resistance over that generated by frictional
losses. 

I found the equation of a best fit line from points plotted using an online calculator of frictional losses vs speed
and then took the residual power to calculate the incline being simulated

Rather than using a servo linear actuator (expensive) I'm using the Arduino Nano 33 IoT BLE's built in
accelerometers to find the position of the bicycle. This method is prone to noise and I have tried
some filtering (moving average) to reduce this.

  The circuit:
    Arduino Nano 33 BLE
    3.3 to 5v level shifter
    L298N H bridge
    750Newton 200mm Linear Actuator
    1x2 pushbutton pad
    128x32 I2C OLED display
    3D printed parts and boxes
    At present a NPE CABLE ANT+ to BLE bridge is required 
    (due to the lack of authentication in the
    AdruinoBLE library 1.1.2)
    
  3D files will be pulished on Thingiverse and more details on Instructables
